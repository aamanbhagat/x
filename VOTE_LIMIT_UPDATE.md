# Vote Limit Update - One Vote Per Player

## 🎯 Changes Made

### **Vote Limit System Implemented**

The voting system now enforces a strict limit: **Total votes = Number of active players**

---

## 🔢 How It Works

### Before (Unlimited Votes):
```
7 active players
User could click Player 1 → 20 times = 20 votes ❌
Total votes could be 50, 100, unlimited
```

### After (Vote Limit):
```
7 active players → Maximum 7 votes allowed ✅
User clicks Player 1 → 7 times → LIMIT REACHED
System blocks further votes until some are removed
```

---

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### 1. **Total Votes Display**

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Total Votes Cast: 23   │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Total Votes Cast: 7/7  │ ← Shows limit
│ ⚠️ Maximum votes        │ ← Warning when full
│    reached!             │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Instructions Updated**

**Before:**
```
💡 Click any player to add a vote
Each click = 1 player's vote
```

**After:**
```
💡 Click any player to add a vote
Total votes limited to 7 (one per player) ← Clear limit
```

### 3. **Warning Message (When Limit Reached)**

When user tries to vote beyond the limit:
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ⚠️ Alert                            ║
║                                      ║
║ Maximum votes reached!               ║
║ You can only cast 7 votes           ║
║ (one per player).                   ║
║                                      ║
║            [OK]                      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### 4. **Incomplete Voting Warning**

When not all votes are cast:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ Only 5/7 votes cast.         │
│ You can add more or continue.   │
│                                  │
│ [Reveal Elimination]             │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 💻 Code Implementation

### Vote Limit Calculation:
```typescript
const activePlayers = players.filter(p => p.isActive);
const totalVotes = Object.values(votes).reduce(...);
const maxVotes = activePlayers.length; // KEY: Limit = player count
```

### Click Handler with Validation:
```typescript
const handlePlayerClick = (playerName: string) => {
  // Check if we've reached the vote limit
  if (totalVotes >= maxVotes) {
    alert(`Maximum votes reached! You can only cast ${maxVotes} votes.`);
    return; // Block the vote
  }
  castVote(playerName); // Allow the vote
};
```

### UI Updates:
```typescript
// Display votes with limit
<span>{totalVotes} / {maxVotes}</span>

// Warning when full
{totalVotes >= maxVotes && (
  <p>⚠️ Maximum votes reached!</p>
)}

// Warning when incomplete
{totalVotes < maxVotes && totalVotes > 0 && (
  <p>⚠️ Only {totalVotes} / {maxVotes} votes cast.</p>
)}
```
