## 📱 TESTING GUIDE

### Quick Test (5 minutes):
1. **Setup**: 3 players, 1 spy, 1 minute timer
2. **Category**: "Mix All"
3. **Reveal**: Check badge shows category
4. **Discussion**: Let timer run to 30s (watch pulse)
5. **Vote**: Each player votes
6. **Result**: Check statistics

### Full Test (15 minutes):
1. **Test all categories** individually
2. **Try different player counts** (2, 4, 8, 12)
3. **Test multiple spies** (2-3)
4. **Theme switching** during game
5. **Settings persistence** (refresh page)
6. **Exit confirmations** work
7. **Win conditions** trigger correctly

### Edge Cases to Test:
- [ ] 2 players, 1 spy
- [ ] 12 players, 3 spies
- [ ] 0 second timer (should fail validation)
- [ ] Remove all players (should prevent start)
- [ ] Word repetition across games
- [ ] Theme persistence across sessions
