```

## 🐛 Known TypeScript Warnings

These are **non-breaking** warnings that don't affect functionality:

```
Parameter 'p' implicitly has an 'any' type
```

These are just type annotations that TypeScript wants but the code works fine without them. Can be fixed later by adding explicit types:

```typescript
// Current
players.filter(p => p.isActive)

// To fix warning
players.filter((p: Player) => p.isActive)
```
